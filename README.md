## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the application and the game starts automatically

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any modern operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Running the Game
1. Compile all Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java SnakeGame
   ```

## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SnakeGame.java      # Main game class and window setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GamePanel.java      # Game loop, rendering, and input handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Snake.java          # Snake entity with movement and collision logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Food.java           # Food entity with generation and animation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Particle.java       # Individual particle for visual effects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ParticleSystem.java # Manages all particle effects

- **Transparency**: Alpha blending for glow and particle effects
- **Dynamic Animations**: Time-based animations for smooth movement

### Performance
- **60 FPS**: Optimized for smooth 60 frames per second
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal overdraw and optimized painting
- **Memory Management**: Automatic particle cleanup and resource management

## Customization

### Visual Customization
- **Colors**: Modify color constants in each class
- **Animations**: Adjust timing and intensity in draw methods
- **Effects**: Customize particle count and behavior in ParticleSystem

### Gameplay Customization
- **Speed**: Adjust `DELAY` constant in GamePanel
- **Grid Size**: Modify `UNIT_SIZE` for different grid sizes
- **Window Size**: Change `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT`

### Sound Customization
- **Volume**: Adjust volume parameters in SoundManager
- **Frequencies**: Modify tone frequencies for different sounds
- **Duration**: Change sound duration for different effects

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|---------|
